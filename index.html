					<h1><strong>Academic Portfolio:<strong></h1>
					<h3>Samuel Alexander Bechtold</h3>
					<p align="left"><strong>I will be graduating from Bridgewater State University
					in May of 2024 with a double-major in Photonic & Optical Engineering and Applied Physics. I also have a minor in
					Computer Engineering. My research is in nonlinear and quantum optics. I am currently working on an Honors Thesis
					on All-Optical Switches utilizing Rogue "Freak" Waves with a modified nonlinear Schr&oumldinger equation. I have multiple 
					collaborations with the Electronic Materials Group at Massachusetts Institute of Technology through MIT Nano's LEAP network
					partnership with BSU, Worchester Polytechnique Institute, and Stonehill college. Other collaborative research projects 
					include the study of Supercontinuum Generation and the design of Photonic Integrated Circuit waveguides that
					can support SCG working with Nippon Telegraph and  Telephone Japan, other projects include partnering with undergraduate
					and graduate students from Universidad Nacional de Colombia - Sede Medellín. The first being experiments on thin film wafers
					with the Z-Scan. The second being research, simulation and testing of designs for an efficient entangled photon source on a PIC.
					Both projects resulted in poster presentations at SPIE Optics + Photonics 2022 and SPIE Photonics West 2023. I've also worked in
					collaboration with vpiPhotonics and faculty from Institut d'Optique Paris-Saclay et Bordeaux on Heterodyne detection
					experiments for the characterization of materials through the utilization of Acousto-Optic Modulation.</strong></p>

					<h2>Bridgewater State University CHIRP nonlinear photonics research group Lab Assistant</h2>
				</header>
				<p align="left">I have also taken Z-Scan measurements of thin-film wafer nonlinear materials for Supercontinuum Generation on a PIC. I also helped design an experimental 
				setup for Heterodyne detection in our lab. I want to study electrical engineering to further enhance my knowledge in the field of photonics and engineering. 
				I have also served as Dr. Serna’s research assistant for three years where I have helped with maintenance and repair of expensive equipment such as our 
				TOPTICA Class 4R OPO Continuous Laser, one of few in commercial use, with a cost of $300,000 USD. I have developed the lab manual for this device, and 
				our Mapleleaf custom PIC characterization station. Through my coursework and research experience I have also had experience running experiments with our 
				Menlo Systems class 3R ELMO femtosecond pulsed laser and the ELMA amplifier. I also have extensive experience aligning and characterizing PICs with our 
				Mapleleaf system and have served as the instructor to new operators in our lab on multiple occasions, including PhD students from MIT. I have also worked 
				in an outreach capacity with our lab through our yearly public lab nights, off campus public outreach events, and as the President and founding member of 
				BSU’s Optica student chapter from Fall 2021 - Spring 2023.</p>

								<h2>About Me</h2>
							</header>
							<p align="left">My family name is <strong>S&aumlmu</strong>. I am a Swiss-American who was born and raised on Cape Cod, Massachusetts.
							I am a returning student after graduating with a bachelors degree in English from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.
							I spent almost a decade working as a Cook, and eventually at a Sous Chef and Manager on Cape Cod and also spent some time in Austin
							Texas where I also worked in the service industry. I've also spent a few years working for Barnstable Public Schools as a Personal Care Assistant
							and Teacher Assistant. Due my change in careers upon re-entering the world of academics, I have a wide range of skills--both social and professional.
							I am currently working for Spark Photonics as a Technologist and spend my free time doing political organizing in my community for Environmental and Social
							Justice issues, having multiple years experience serving on the executive committee for Sierra Club Cape Cod and other progressive organizations.</p>

						<h2><strong>Research Collaborations<strong></h2>
					</header>
					<p align="left">As part of Dr. Samuel Serna’s research in the state-of-the-art Photonics & Optical Engineering  laboratory at Bridgewater State University, I have collaborated
						 with MIT’s EMAT research group, NTT Japan, students from Universidad Nacional de Colombia and researchers from Institut d'Optique. These collaborations have bolstered my 
						 enthusiasm for photonics and its deep connection to materials science and electrical engineering. Through these collaborations I have co-authored posters and proceedings 
						 for SPIE Optics + Photonics 2022, and SPIE Photonics West 2023.</p>

							<h3><strong>Massachusetts Institute of Technology<strong></h3>
								<p align="left">I began collaborations with Massachusetts Institute of Technology through the Electronics Materials Group as part of their now annual Integrated
									Photonics Bootcamp, coordinated by Dr. Anuradha Agarwal in collaboration with Bridgewater State University through Dr. Samuel Serna-Otalvaro. This Bootcamp partners
									with American Institute for Manufacturing Integrated Photonics, AIM Photonics. This bootcamp was my first opportunity to both educate peers, graduate students, and 
									members of industry on photonics, through the laboratory demonstration of the thermo-optic effect with IPEK's educational packaged Photonic Integrated Circuit implementation of a 
									Mach-Zhender Interferometer with an electrical DC input in 2022 and 2023. I have also been working on collaborations with Dr. Kazumi Wada, Dr. Agarwal, Dr. Serna, Dr. Worawat Traiwattanapong, 
									and PhD student Katherine Stoll from the Electronics Materials Group at MIT and a team at Nippon Telegram and Telephone in Japan on research involving Supercontinuum Generation on a Photonic 
									Integrate Circuit. Currently, I am working as an Undergraduate Grant Assistant to Dr. Serna for our collaboration with MIT on the National Science Foundation Convergence Accelerator Grant,
									where we alongside the MIT-EMAT team are developing FUTUR-IC, an innitiave that aims to reshape the microelectronics and microphotonics industry into a circular, sustainable industry that
									designs products that are intended to be repaired, recycled, and ultimately upgraded rather than thrown into the waste stream.<p>

							<h3><strong>Universidad Nacional de Colombia - Sede Medellín<strong></h3>
								<p align="left">In my first semester at Bridgewater State University in the Fall of 2021 I was awarded an MIT-NASA Research Grant to work on the Z-Scan experimental set-up 
								currently residing in the state-of-the-art Integrated Photonics lab at BSU. I was able to take measurements that helped in the characterization of a Silicon wafer, which 
								served as the basis sample for future characterizations of new nonlinear materials. This work lead to a co-authorship on a poster presentation at SPIE: Optics + Photonics
								2022 in San Diego, California with Juan Jose Arango Uribe, a graduate of Universidad Nacional de Colombia - Sede Medellín. In the Fall of 2022 BSU was fortunate to host a masters 
								student from Universidad Nacional de Colombia - Sede Medellín Pablo Bedoya Ríos who was working on his thesis on efficient sources of entangled photonics on a Photonics
								Integrated Circuit. I was given the opportunity to collaborate with Pablo for part of his thesis work, where I helped him develop simulations for an nonlinear optical effect
								known as Four-Wave Mixing where we simulated the nonlinear Shrödinger equation to model the effects of dispersion on the generation of new frequencies of light. My collaboration
								culminated in co-authoring a poster presentation on this research at SPIE Photonics West 2023 in San Francisco, California.
